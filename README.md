# Biostar-Lab

Welcome to **Biostar-Lab**! "\U1F680" This repository is my personal learning space for bioinformatics, inspired by the *Biostar Handbook*. Each chapter in the book is represented as a folder in this repository, containing notes, scripts, and exercises as I progress through the material.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


## Installation and Setup

This section covers how to set up the environment to start working with bioinformatics tools and libraries.

### Step 1: Install Conda

Conda is a package and environment manager that simplifies the installation of bioinformatics tools and Python/R libraries.  

1. **Download Miniconda**  
   Visit the [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) website and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).  
   
2. **Install Miniconda**  
   Follow the instructions for your operating system to install Miniconda. For example, on Linux:  
   ```bash
   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh


## Goals

- Develop hands-on skills in bioinformatics.
- Practice analyzing biological data using the tools and techniques introduced in the *Biostar Handbook*.
- Build a foundational understanding of genomics, transcriptomics, and other bioinformatics concepts.

## Tools & Technologies

This repository may include examples and exercises involving:

- **Python**
- **R**
- **Bash/Shell scripting**
- Tools like **BLAST**, **Bowtie**, **SAMtools**, and more.
